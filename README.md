# Hycore

### About

`hycore` provides a flexible data structure for creating, managing and analysing hyperspectral drillcore datasets using python and [`hylite`](https://github.com/hifexplo/hylite).

It provides a python interface for managing and querying hierarchical directory structures (called "sheds") containing a directory for each drillcore and, within this, a directory for each core box. `hycore` facilitates seamless loading (and, after processing, saving) of hyperspectral images from these box directories, as well as other common tasks like building drillcore mosaics.
